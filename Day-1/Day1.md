Day 1: My answer is one result shy of the correct answer. I'm planning to revisit to try to find the correct way of pulling the answer.

Answer 2 was answered by tweaking the code from answer 1 to check if the sum of three numbers were greater than or less than the sum of the next three numbers

made a change so it can be reviewed
